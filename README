CCAlertView README file.

I was in need of an alertview that I could modify easily, but wanted it to closely mimic the UIAlertView properties. The CCAlertView has a built in "Bounce-In" like UIAlertView. It also has modifiable labels and button text. A version is underway that will allow the addition of a UITextField, similar to Apple's Username and Password prompt.

I will add more to this file as time allows.

Thank You and Enjoy!
